To make the wait for the trip to Iceland more fun,
given the locations (latitude and longitude) of the places we are interested in visiting and the number of days we will be able to tour the country
 we will find as many clusters of places as days of stay.
 Then we will solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the optimal order to visit, considering personal constraints.
